Database Column Name,Table Label,Description
kepid,Kepler Identification or KepID,"Target identification number, as listed in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). 
The KIC was derived from a ground-based imaging survey of the Kepler field 
conducted prior to launch. The survey's purpose was to identify stars for 
the Kepler exoplanet survey by magnitude and color. The full catalog of 13
 million sources can be searched at the MAST archive. The subset of 
 4 million targets found upon the Kepler CCDs can be searched via the 
 Kepler Target Search form. The Kepler ID is unique to a target and 
there is only one Kepler ID per target."
kepoi_name,KOI Name,"A number used to identify and track a Kepler Object of Interest (KOI). 
A KOI is a target identified by the Kepler Project that displays at 
least one transit-like sequence within Kepler time-series photometry 
that appears to be of astrophysical origin and initially consistent 
with a planetary transit hypothesis. A KOI name has an integer and a 
decimal part of the format KNNNNN.DD. The integer part designates the 
target star; the two-digit decimal part identifies a unique transiting 
object associated with that star. It is not necessarily the planetary 
candidate listed in that order within a DV report, nor does it indicate 
the distance of the planet from the the host star relative to other 
planets in the system."
kepler_name,Kepler Name,"Kepler number name in the form ""Kepler-N,"" plus a lower-case letter, identifying the planet. In general, these numbers are easier to remember than the corresponding KOI or KIC/KepID designations and are intended to clearly indicate a class of objects that have been confirmed or validated as planets‚Äùa step up from the planet candidate designation."
koi_disposition,Exoplanet Archive Disposition,"The category of this KOI from the Exoplanet Archive. Current values 
are CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED or CONFIRMED. All 
KOIs marked as CONFIRMED are also listed in the Exoplanet Archive 
Confirmed Planet table. Designations of CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE, 
and NOT DISPOSITIONED are taken from the Disposition 
Using Kepler Data."
koi_pdisposition,Disposition Using Kepler Data,"The pipeline flag that designates the most probable physical 
explanation of the KOI. Typical values are FALSE POSITIVE, 
NOT DISPOSITIONED, and CANDIDATE. The value of this flag may 
change over time as the evaluation of KOIs proceeds to deeper 
levels of analysis using Kepler time-series pixel and light 
curve data, or follow-up observations. A not dispositioned 
value corresponds to objects for which the disposition tests 
have not yet been completed. A false positive has failed at 
least one of the tests described in Batalha et al. (2012). 
A planetary candidate has passed all prior tests conducted 
to identify false positives, although this does not a priori 
mean that all possible tests have been conducted. A future 
test may confirm this KOI as a false positive.  

False positives can occur when: 
    1) the KOI is in reality an eclipsing binary star,  
    2) the Kepler light curve is contaminated by a background eclipsing binary, 
    3) stellar variability is confused for coherent planetary transits, or 
    4) instrumental artifacts are confused for coherent planetary transits."
koi_score,Disposition Score,"A value between 0 and 1 that indicates the confidence in the KOI disposition. 
For CANDIDATEs, a higher value indicates 
more confidence in its disposition, while for FALSE POSITIVEs, a higher value 
indicates less confidence in that disposition. The value is calculated from a Monte Carlo technique such that the score's value is equivalent to the frction of iterations where the Robovetter yields a disposition of CANDIDATE."
koi_period,Orbital Period (days),The interval between consecutive planetary transits.
koi_time0bk,"Transit Epoch (BJD - 2,454,833.0)","The time corresponding to the center of the first 
detected transit in Barycentric Julian Day (BJD) 
minus a constant offset of 2,454,833.0 days. The 
offset corresponds to 12:00 on Jan 1, 2009 UTC."
koi_impact,Impact Parameter,"The sky-projected distance between the center 
of the stellar disc and the center of the 
planet disc at conjunction, normalized by the 
stellar radius."
koi_duration,Transit Duration (hours),"The duration of the observed transits. Duration is 
measured from first contact between the planet and 
star until last contact. Contact times are typically 
computed from a best-fit model produced by a Mandel-Agol (2002) model fit to a multi-quarter 
Kepler light curve, assuming a linear orbital ephemeris."
koi_depth,Transit Depth (parts per million),"The fraction of stellar flux lost at the minimum of the 
planetary transit. Transit depths are typically computed 
from a best-fit model produced by a Mandel-Agol (2002) model fit to a multi-quarter Kepler light curve, assuming 
a linear orbital ephemeris."
koi_prad,Planetary Radius (Earth radii),"The radius of the planet. Planetary radius is 
the product of the planet star radius ratio 
and the stellar radius."
koi_teq,Equilibrium Temperature (Kelvin),"Approximation for the temperature of the planet. 
The calculation of equilibrium temperature assumes 
a) thermodynamic equilibrium between the incident 
stellar flux and the radiated heat from the planet, 
b) a Bond albedo (the fraction of total power 
incident upon the planet scattered back into space) 
of 0.3, c) the planet and star are blackbodies, and 
d) the heat is evenly distributed between the day 
and night sides of the planet."
koi_insol,Insolation Flux [Earth flux],"Insolation flux is another way to give the equilibrium temperature. 
It depends on the stellar parameters (specifically the stellar radius 
and temperature), and on the semi-major axis of the planet. It's given
in units relative to those measured for the Earth from the Sun."
koi_model_snr,Transit Signal-to-Noise,"Transit depth normalized by the mean uncertainty 
      in the flux during the transits."
koi_tce_plnt_num,TCE Planet Number,TCE Planet Number federated to the KOI.
koi_tce_delivname,TCE Delivery Name,"TCE delivery name corresponding to 
the TCE data federated to the KOI."
koi_steff,Stellar Effective Temperature (Kelvin),The photospheric temperature of the star.
koi_slogg,Stellar Surface Gravity (log10(cm s-2),"The base-10 logarithm of the acceleration 
	  due to gravity at the surface of the star."
koi_srad,Stellar Radius (solar radii),The photospheric radius of the star
ra,RA (deg),KIC Right Ascension
dec,Dec (deg),KIC Declination
koi_kepmag,Kepler-band (mag),Kepler-band (mag)
